# PennMegle
CIS-196 Final Project

PennMegle is a Reddit-like social media that incorporates video chatting functionality in a way similar to Zoom combined with Omegle. Users can create accounts, join or create “channels” focused on specific topics (similar to a subreddit), and create temporary “rooms”, where anybody belonging to a channel can join and video chat with strangers with similar interests.
PennMegle was created using Ruby on Rails; the frontend is coded using HTML/CSS, and embedded Ruby.
